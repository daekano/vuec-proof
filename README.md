> A Vue.js project

Install with yarn.

To test:

```
$ yarn run unit
```
Should pass

```
$ yarn run e2e
```
This will fail eventually, but is set to run for a long duration.
Check the browser console at http://localhost:8080.
Change '#appa' to '#app' in test/e2e/specs/test.js to see the e2e fail.
